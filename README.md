# Horiseon Accessibility Refractoring README - Week 1 Challenge

## Project Description:

A local marketing agency has requested that their site's accessiblity be improved. Once this is completed, the site should rank better in search results and better serve users with disabilities. The purpose of this project, then, is to achieve this desired accessibility through:

* Making improvements in the site's semantic HTML5 structure (and ensure it aligns logically) 
* Reducing redundancies witin the CSS 
* Ensuring all icons/images have alt tags
* Creating a concise yet descriptive title 
* Checking all links

## User Story:

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
